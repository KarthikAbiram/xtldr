# Git
Git is a distributed version control system that are used for tracking changes in files and sharing those with team members. 

It is like a time machine for your computer files. It keeps track of every change you make, allowing you to go back to any point in time. It's great for teamwork, ensuring everyone works on the same version without stepping on each other's toes.

## üõ§Ô∏èTypical Flow
Typical steps to contribute to an open source repository:

1. Create a fork of the repo under your account
2. Clone the above fork in your PC
```
git clone [url]
```
3. Create and checkout a new branch
```
git branch [your-new-branch-name]
git checkout [your-new-branch-name]
```
4. Make changes and commit with your signature
```
git commit -s -m [your commit message]
```
5. Push branch to your online repo
```
git push -u origin [your-new-branch-name]
```
6. Create a pull request with your new branch in the open source repository.
 
## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Advanced

### ‚û°Ô∏è Binary Merge Conflicts
If you don't have options to resolve merge conflicts for binary files, you would want to choose to go with the version in one of the branches.

To go with "your" version (the version in active branch):
```bash
git checkout --ours [file-name]
git add [file-name]
```

To go with "their" version (the branch which you are merging changes from, to the active branch):
```bash
git checkout --theirs [file-name]
git add [file-name]
```
For usage with all files, use `.` instead of file-name.

To better understand ours vs theirs, refer to [git ours vs theirs](https://nitaym.github.io/ourstheirs/)

### ‚û°Ô∏è Partial Merge
If you want to merge selective files from one branch into another, you can use the command, which will perform the merge, add items to staging but not make the commit. You can then reset the changes for files you don't want and then make the commit.

```bash
git merge [branch-name] --no-commit --no-ff
# Now all changes from the branch are in staging, but not committed yet
# Use git reset to discard files you don't want in the merge
git reset [file-name-1]
git reset [file-name-2]
# Once done, make the commit
git commit
```
