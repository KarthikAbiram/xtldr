# Git
Git is a distributed version control system that are used for tracking changes in files and sharing those with team members. 

It is like a time machine for your computer files. It keeps track of every change you make, allowing you to go back to any point in time. It's great for teamwork, ensuring everyone works on the same version without stepping on each other's toes.
