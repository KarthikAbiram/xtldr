# Docker
Docker is a containerization technology which helps to package the application along with all its dependencies and run times, so that there are no dependencies/expectations on the end user system. It is similar to a virtual machine but a lot lighter.

## üìë Docker Cheat Sheet
[Docker Cheat Sheet](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker_cheatsheet.pdf)

## üêã Running Your First Docker Container
You can search for images at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/). In the docker image page, you would have instructions on how to pull the image and use it. Example: [https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)

To pull (download) an image:
```bash
docker pull <image_name>
```

Use 'docker run' to create and run a new container. If the image can't be found, it will automatically pull.
```bash
docker run <image_name>
```
Or, alternatively:
```bash
docker create <image_name> # Outputs container id. Use this for the docker start command
docker start <container_name_or_container_id>
```

To run it as a container in background (detached) mode:

```bash
docker run -d <image_name>
```

To run it with a custom name for the container:
```bash
docker run -d --name <container_name> <image_name>
```

Container name needs to be unique. Rerunning the above command again would result in an error.

To delete a container:
```bash
docker rm <container_name>
```

To run the container and map the host port with the container port:
```bash
docker run -d --name <container_name> -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
```

Some configurations like naming the container, mapping the port can be made only when creating a container and these configurations can't be edited or modified after the container is created. If you need to modify them, you need to delete and recreate the container.

To stop the container:
```bash
docker stop <container_name_or_container_id>
```

To start the container:
```bash
docker start <container_name_or_container_id>
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Docker Container Shell
To get into the terminal of a running docker container:
```bash
docker exec -it container-name sh
```
If 'sh' didn't work, you can try 'bash' (one of these two are typically expected within a container).

Once inside the terminal of the docker container, you can run commands within the container. Few useful commands to use here are:
```bash
# List Directory
ls

# Present Working Directory
pwd

# Go one folder level back
cd ..

# List the environment variables within the container
env
```
### üìú Logs
```bash
# Get logs from container
docker container-name logs

# Get last few logs
docker container-name logs | tail

# Stream the logs
docker container-name logs -f
```
### üóÑÔ∏è Docker Volume
The file system in containers are would be lost when the containers are restarted. To avoid this and have data persistence, we do a mapping of host volume to the container volume.

Example:
```bash
docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container my_image
```
It is possible to provide a friendly name for the host volume, instead of providing an absolute path.
```bash
docker run -v my_named_volume:/path/in/container my_image
```
## üßä Building Docker Image

### üìÑ DockerFile
File name must be called 'DockerFile'. Some useful commands to use inside the dockerfile are:
```docker
FROM - Source Image on top of which we are building our image
ENV - Set an environment variable (instead of this, preferable to use env  externally using docker compose)
RUN - Run a command inside the container. Can use multiple RUN commands in a docker file.
COPY - Copy from host to container
CMD - Entry Point Command for container. Only 1 per container.
```

### üèóÔ∏è Docker Build
Build a docker image with the provided name and tag. 
```bash
docker build -t  [image-name]:[version] . 
```

The last argument in above command indicates the build context being passed for the docker build, which would be used by the COPY and other such commands. Using "." indicates to pass the current directory for the build context.

??? "Private Docker Registry"
    One option is to create a docker registry in AWS, by choosing ECR - Elastic Container Registry. AWS ECR supports maintaining only 1 container image in ECR. There are other options like 'Digital Ocean', where they allow having multiple images pushed to a single docker registry.

    To push an image to a private repository:

    1. You need to login to the docker's private repository (once at the beginning of the session).
    2. Then use docker push. Example: 
    ```
    docker push [docker-registry-domain/container-name:tag]
    ```

    AWS CLI and credentials has to be configured.
