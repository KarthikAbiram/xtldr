# Jupyter

uv init
uv add --dev ipykernel

Once the project directory is open in VS Code, you can create a new Jupyter notebook by selecting "Create: New Jupyter Notebook" from the command palette. When prompted to select a kernel, choose "Python Environments" and select the virtual environment you created earlier (e.g., .venv/bin/python on macOS and Linux, or .venv\Scripts\python on Windows).
