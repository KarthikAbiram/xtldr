# Impact Players
These are my book notes of the book 'Impact Players' by Liz Wiseman.

## Who are Impact Players?
In every organization there are Impact Players - those indispensable colleagues who can be counted on in critical situations and who consistently receive high profile assignments and new opportunities. Managers know who these top players are, whether they are center stage or behind the scenes and want more of them on their team. 

## Impact Player Mindset
Wiseman explains what the most influential leaders are doing differently; how small and seemingly insignificant differences in the way we think and act can make an enormous impact; and why - with little coaching - this mindset is available to everyone who wants to perform at their peak.

1. While others do their job, Impact Players figure out the real job to be done.
2. While others wait for direction, Impact Players step up and lead.
3. While others escalate problems, Impact Players move things across the finish line.
4. While others attempt to minimize change, Impact Players are learning and adapting to change.
5. While others add to the load, Impact Players make heavy demands feel lighter.


## What does your user really care about?
Here is an example for #1 - corporate training world usually operated on training more people. Reports were sent to executives on how many trainings had been conducted and how many attended. These reports were largely ignored. Ben, one of the training directors stepped back and asked - what do the executives really care about? When Ben put himself in the executive's shoes, he realized that he wouldn't really care how much training people attended; he would care about how ready they were to work with customers to sell and support new products. Instead of training attendance, he introduced a readiness metric with self study and certifications and improved the training plan. Senior executives were now actively engaged because Ben was making it easier for them to do their jobs.
