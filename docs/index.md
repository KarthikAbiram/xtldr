# What is xTLDR?
# The absolute fastest way to get started with anything.

We want to get a beginner user to quickly get started with a new concept or tech stack. The TLDR version of X.

We may not cover all aspects and features in depth (there are official guides for that). Instead, we specifically target for an absolute beginner to understand the basic usage *fast*. We want to save users time on starting on something new by guiding them on the basic/common usage of a tech stack or concept.
