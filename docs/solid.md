# SOLID
## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only responsibility.

## Open Closed Principle (OCP)
Open for extensions and closed for modifications.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Base class objects can be replaced by child class object.

## Interface Segregation Principle
Don't force implementation methods which are not needed/used by child class. Use smaller interfaces.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Use Abstract layer in between.
