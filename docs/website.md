# Website
This page lists different options that are available to create a static website (like this one). Most of them support markdown and are beginner friendly. Hosting can be done using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Unlimited Github Project Sites
There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization.

Unless you're using a custom domain, user and organization sites are available at http(s)://<username>.github.io or http(s)://<organization>.github.io.

The source files for a project site are stored in the same repository as their project. Unless you're using a custom domain, project sites are available at http(s)://<username>.github.io/<repository> or http(s)://<organization>.github.io/<repository>

You can only create one user or organization site for each account on GitHub. Project sites, whether owned by an organization or a personal account, are unlimited. It is possible to [configure custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages) for all three.
