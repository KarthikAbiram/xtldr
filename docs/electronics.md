## Electricity
Basic Analogy - Nature always tries to balance - like water flowing from a higher point to a lower point, an item with high temperature passing it out to nearby surroundings till they are at balance.

Similarly in a battery, there is lot of electrons in one side itching to go to the other side, where there is lesser electrons. When a path (a closed circuit) forms, the electrons start traveling from negative to positive. 

!!! note "Current & Voltage"
    Current is the rate at which electric charges (electrons) pass through a specific point in a circuit.
    When the number of electrons on the negative side is more, there would be lot of pressure to go from negative to positive. This difference in pressure (electrons) is the voltage.

!!! question
    While electrons move from -ve to +ve, by convention, we say electricity travels from +ve to -ve. Why?
